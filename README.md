Pok√©dex

Pokemon is my favorite childhood game so I created Pokedex.

I wrote HTML and CSS. Then with a little help from this amazing tutorial by Justin Kim (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXjSaZb67n8) I created Javascript.

Pokedex is not responsive and displays properly only on big screens.

Have fun and catch 'em all!
